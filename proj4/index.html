		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p> The goal of this project was to create a real-time cloth simulation. In order to do this, we used a mass and
			spring based system. We first create the cloth with a grid of masses and three different types of springs,
			structural, shearing, and bending. We then use numerical integration to simulate how the cloth moves over
			time. Throughout this, we must be careful to make sure our simulation is efficient and performant, as the
			goal is a real-time simulation. After creating our cloth, we implement collisions with spheres and planes,
			and then implement self-collision to finish the cloth mechanics. For self collision in particular, we use a
			hashmap to store nearby masses to limit the point masses we must check, therefore avoiding the O(n&sup2)
			implementation which would be too slow!<br><br>Finally, we implement various GLSL shaders
			for some cool results to cap off the project! The GLSL shaders were quite interesting and fun. While they
			are ofcourse similiar to other types of programming in many senses, it is different than what we have worked
			on in the past and a refreshing change of pace!</p>

		<p>When we set the ks = 50 the cloth falls more in the center compared to default and is wavier when falling.
			This is especially true compared to when we set ks = 50000. The cloth is much stiffer and doesn’t move as
			much falling and the center drops less from the two pins. This makes sense because as our spring constant is
			lower the tension between point masses is smaller allowing the cloth to fall more compared to a higher
			spring constant.

		<p>When we set the density to 1 the cloth falls a lot less in the center compared to the default density of 15
			between the two pinned corners and doesn’t move much after falling. This is highlighted when we increase
			density to 100 and the center of the cloth between the two pinned points droops a lot. This makes sense as a
			dense cloth means the point masses weigh more and are less affected by the spring force compared to the
			gravitational force.</p>

		<p>When we lower damping form 0.2% to 0.02% the cloth is a lot more wavy and takes a long time for it to come to

			to when the damping is set to 1% the cloth falls slowly and doesn’t swing back and forth.

		<p>
			As we can see, the higher KS is, the more the cloth is able to "hold up itself". At a lower KS, the cloth
			droops completely down as if it can't quite fight against gravity, and that the part of the cloth ontop of
			the sphere can't hold on to the rest of it. With a higher KS, we can see that the cloth almost becomes more
			stiff and acts like what we would think a "thicker" or less flexible cloth might look like when drooped over
			the sphere. The sides are able to hold themselves up and don't deform as much.

		<p>As we can see with, there is a stark contrast in how the cloth behaves when you change it's density. In the
			initial collision at a high density, the cloth becomes much more wrinkled with finer folds, and folds over
			it self many more times in smaller folds as well. In contrast, the lower-density cloth folds in larger waves
			without the tiny wrinkles observed in the higher-density cloth. This can be further observed below when the
			two clothes come to a rest. As we can see once the cloth has come to a rest, with a higher density the
			minute wrinkles and smaller folds still remain. In contrast, the low density cloth has fewer folds that are
			larger and less wrinkles.</p>

		<div align="middle">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr align="center">

		</div>

		<p>Similar to the density change from above, we can see that changing our parameters affects the cloth mainly in
			how it folds onto itself and the amount and detail of wrinkles. However, in this instance increasing KS
			produces results somewhat similiar to the low-density cloth, which folded unto itself in larger waves rather
			than in an extremely detailed and complex fashion. We can see that with low KS, the cloth folds over itself
			in a very convoluted fashion. Again, we can observe this at rest as well, where the High KS cloth has come
			to an extremely nice and satisfying, almost flat rest, where as the Low KS cloth still like a mess.</p>

		<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
		<h3 align="middle">Shader Overview</h3>

		<p>A shader program is a fancy piece of programming that works on a graphics card to create visual effects like
			lighting and material properties. In our case, we are using the shader language GLSL for this class. Shaders
			are able to run quickly on the GPU because they can work in parallel. As such, certain parts of shaders like
			<i>uniform</i> variables are read-only to prevent possible issues. Shaders are split into two parts, the
			vertex shader and the fragment shader. The vertex shader is what we use to change the position,
			of every vertices in the 3D models on screen! The fragment shader, on the other hand, decides the
			color of each pixel in the final rendered image. Therefore, the vertex
			shader is where we might do something like displacement mapping, but something like a diffusion shader would
			happpen in the fragment shader. By combining these two shaders, it is possible to develop a lot of
			unimaginable effects if you use them creatively!
		</p>

		<h3 align="middle">Blinn-Phong Shading</h3>

		<p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is a way to add more realistic lighting when rendering our 3D objects.The
			principal idea is to compute two separate lighting components: The specular component, (which is the really
			shiny bit you expect to see) and the diffuse component (basically "everything else"). So, the diffuse
			component is how much light is absorbed or scattered by the surface, while the specular component is
			how much light is reflected off of the surface to the viewer. In the Blinn-Phong model, we calculate both of
			these and then combine it to get the final color of each pixel in the image. This creates good looking
			lighting while still being performant.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Bump mapping and Displacement Mapping seem to give the same results until you take a closer look. Bump
			mapping "creates" bumps and wrinkles on the surface of an object by adjusting the surface normal of
			the object. This makes it look like the object has a high level of detail on its surface, while in reality
			it's just the normals that have been changed rather than the actual geometry. Displacement mapping, on the
			other hand, actually changes changes the geometry of the object by moving its vertices to actually create
			said bumps and wrinkles. This difference is exaggerated in the example below.</p>

		<div align="middle">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr align="center">
					<td>
						<img src="images/pt5/bump_16.png" align="middle" width="480px" />
						<figcaption><var>Bump Mapping: -o 16 -a 16</var></figcaption>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p> As we can see, the sphere mesh's coarseness doesn't matter for the Bump mapping at all. This is because, as
			explained above, we are just changing the normals at each point on the surface of the sphere, so the
			geometry here doesn't change anything. However, we can see that when we use displacement mapping, the sphere
			mesh's coarseness matters greatly. At a low 3D resolution, (-o 16 -a 16) we don't have enough detail to make
			the neccessary changes without the sphere looking chunky and deformed. However, at the 3D higher resolution,
			we have much more room to adjust vertices without deforming the sphere, creating a more convincing and nicer
			effect.</p>
