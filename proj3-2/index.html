                Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.
            </b></p>
        <p>
            As expected, in the first image with <var>m = 0</var>, we only see the light itself. With <var>m =
                1</var>, we see everything the light directly illuminates: the walls, and the initial specular
            reflection in the ball. For the mirrored sphere, the rest is dark because the second bounce required to
            create the mirror hasn't happened yet! For the glass sphere, any light that isn't directly reflected is
            refracted, which also hasn't happened yet! This is why both spheres are dark. With an additional bounce
            <var>m = 2</var>, the mirrored sphere reflects now but the glass sphere is still mostly dark. Finally
            with <var>m = 3</var>, we see the glass sphere as we expect. Notice the light below the glass sphere
            that has been refracted through. Also, notice the much brighter shadows under both spheres. However, in
            the mirrored sphere the glass sphere is still dark, since it's mirrored rays are lagging one bounce
            behind! Now if we move to <var>m = 4</var>, we can see this is fixed, and we additionally see some light
            cast onto the wall to the right of the glass sphere. On <var>m = 5</var>, this small light appears to
            show up <i>through</i> the glass sphere in the mirrored sphere, but it can be difficult to tell at low
            resolution like this. Beyond this and at <var>m = 100</var> there are no significant changes really.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>

        <p><b>
                In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model.
            </b></p>
        <p>
            In the pinhole camera model, the image produced is always in focus, regardless of the distance between
            the camera and the object being captured. This is because the pinhole camera model assumes that light
            travels in straight lines and forms a sharp image on the opposite side of a small hole. However, in the
            thin lens camera model we consider the bending of light rays through the lens itself, which can
            therefore cause a blurred image on the sensor. Therefore, different variables come into play in our
            final image, such as the aperture size, the focus distance, and distance to the picture object(s). We
            can adjust these variables to change the focus of the image in a way that we think looks best!
            However, in the thin-lens camera model, the distance between the lens and the object affects the focus, and
            the image becomes less sharp if the object is too far or too close to the lens. Additionally, the thin-lens
            camera model provides a more accurate representation of real-world cameras and is commonly used in computer
            graphics and computer vision.
