		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p> Overall, this project was quite enjoyable, and I felt that the two different sections were both interesting
			as well as useful. Bezier curves are a staple of any digital design tool in use today, and so It felt
			worthwhile to learn how they work and implement them ourselves. Further, we had never really thought of the
			fact that bezier curves could also be used in 3D space as <i>Bezier Surfaces</i>. Ofcourse, it makes sense
			now, but it had never come to mind before. For the next part of the project, we implemented the several
			triangle mesh methods in order to view and edit COLLADA (.dae) files. First, Phong shading was an excellent
			introduction to the half edge data structure, which proved to be a challenge in it's own regard. The shading
			itself however is an extremely powerful tool and it felt great to see such a great looking result! On the
			topic of the half-edge mesh, it was an absolute pain to work with at the beggining, but once we fully
			understood it, it felt really powerful and honestly we were amazed at how powerful and ingenious it was.
			Edge flipping and splitting put these half-edge skills to the test, and it was satisfying to finally see
			them work together to produce an incredibly useful result after implementing loop division.</p>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


		<b>
			Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
		</b>
		<p>
			de Casteljau's algorithm allows us to evaluate any Bezier curve. The algorithm works recursively by using
			linear interpolation and a constant, t (0 <= t <=1). We implemented it by looping through all the points at
				the given step and performing linear interpolation on the points next to each other. Then for the
				evaluate step function we push the new linearly interpolated point to the end of the vector. This allows
				us to perform evaluteStep, until we get our final point meaning there is only one point in our vector.
				</p>

					Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of
					your
					choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

				<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
				<b>
					Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in
					order to
					evaluate Bezier surfaces.
				</b>
				<p>
					De Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by having two constants u and v in replace of t.
					The idea is to use u first, to find where our points would align for the bezier curves that make up
					our surface. Then we can use v, to calculate the point of our new line created from the point of u.
					This gives us a corresponding point in (u,v) space using de Casteljau's algorithm. To implement this
					we now are given a matrix and calculate our u points first by performing 1D de Casteljau's algorithm
					on the rows of our matrix. Then we can simply perform 1D de Casteljau's algorithm again with v on
					the points we got from our rows and u which results in our final point.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
		</b>
		<p>
			We implemented area-weighted vertex normals by using the half-edge of our current face to traverse the face
			to get it’s vertices and create vectors to calculate the face area and normal. We then added the weighted
			normal by adding the normal * area to our sumWeightedNormal variable. Once we got through all the faces we
			returned the unit version of our sumWeightedNormal divided by the total area of our surface.

			The above ASCII art took way too long to create! Please enjoy it. The edge flip operation was not too
			complex, but like the later edge split, the devil is in the details. We implemented this by drawing the full
			edge flip operation on paper, and carefully labeling the two triangles (like above with the half edges, but
			in greater detail) before and after the operation. Afterwards, it was a simple matter of going through every
			half edge in the diagram above, and making sure it was correctly set to its new neighbors. Ofcourse, we also
			did these for vertices, faces, and edges exhaustively to make sure everything was correct. Labeling on paper
			really helped us because we could use the same labels as variable names within our code, without loss of
			generality! So, we could have our "left" half-edge and use that with our diagram, even though in the real
			application the half-edge provided might have been on the right of a certain edge.

			Debugging for this part wasn't too bad, so I'll save those stories for Edge Split and Loop division!

			More pretty ascii art! Same rules apply.

			The edge splitting was similiar to the edge flipping but with much more details, and much more capable of
			going wrong. Again, it was extremely useful to label the points, edges, and faces on paper and use those
			same labels and patterns in our code. Like mentioned earlier, we could do this without loss of generality,
			which was helpful. For example, in our implementation I deleted the original edge (<code>CB</code>) and
			created four new edges, <code>left, right, top, and bottom</code>. Ofcourse, these edges won't actually line
			up like that, but as long as we keep their relationships correct, it doesn't matter! We also created 8 new
			half-edges and two new faces for our split, and carefully assigned all the neighbors. One part that gave me
			trouble was later forgetting to set the new half edges for our <i>old</i> vertices, which only presented
			itself as a problem in loop division. Additionally, we created a new member variable for the
			<code>Edge</code> class called <code>shouldFlip</code>. This boolean is only set to true for the "left" and
			"right" edges, which are the true <i>new</i> edges. This will be used for loop division later, in conjuction
			with another method for determining edge flips. Finally, we also made to sure to set
			<code>isNew = true</code> for all the edges and vertex created in order to make sure we don't loop
			infinitely in task 6.

			Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
		</b>
		<p>
			Debugging was a wild ride, to say the least. I thought I had cleared all the issues in this part, but only
			encountered more in task 6. However, one thing that really helped us debug was using LLDB, which in many
			ways was more competent than the built-in CLION debugger. Because of the weird nature of all the half-edge
			elements being represented as iterators, it was very difficult to get CLlion to actually present any of the
			class's information, as it would only point to the pointer for the next object, and so forth. LLDB was
			useful because we could use the print function to actually print out member information and so on!

		<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
		<b>
			Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation
			/
			debugging tricks you have used.
		</b>
		<p>
			The first step for loop subdivison was calculating the new position for all old vertices. We wrote a member
			function for the vertex class called <code>computeSumNeighbors()</code> that iterates through all the
			neighbors of a vertex and returns the sum of their position. Then, using the degree of the vertex and the
			formulas discussed in class, we calculate the new position for each vertex and store it in
			<code>newPosition</code>. Next, we iterate through each edge and calculate the position (using the formula
			discussed in class) for the vertex that
			will be created when we split there, and we store this in each edge. Since edges are destroyed in our split
			function, we make sure to copy this data over to the new edges in the split function. Then, we iterate
			through each old edge and split it, making sure to assign the new vertex's position to the one we just
			calculated.
			<br>
			Now we do the edge flipping, which managed to stump us for a while. The key here is that it shouldn't just
			be any edge that connects an old and new edge (which we had checked for using some <code>if</code>
			statements). It <i>also</i> has to be one of the "left" or "right" edges from our diagram above! As we were
			initially sure this part was correct, we tried many solutions to fix our broken loop division. Finally
			however, I decided to remove the edge-flipping part and flip the edges by hand! This gave me the total
			number of edges that needed to be flipped which made me realize our error. For the last step, we make sure
			to set the position of each vertex to it's <code>newPosition</code>.
		</p>

		<b>
			Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop
			subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting
			some
			edges?
		</b>
		<p>
			Loop subdivision definetly reduces sharp corners and edges. This can easily be see by repeatedly subdiving a
			cube!
